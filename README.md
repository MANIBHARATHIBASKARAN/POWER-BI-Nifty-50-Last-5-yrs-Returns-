# NIFTY 50 Last 10 Years Data Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the **NIFTY 50** index over the past 10 years using data visualization tools. The data includes key stock market metrics, which are analyzed and visualized using **Power BI**.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   I created an **Excel sheet** with 10 years of historical data for the NIFTY 50 index. The dataset includes the following columns:
   - **Date**: The specific trading date.
   - **Open**: The stock index value at the start of the trading day.
   - **High**: The highest value reached during the day.
   - **Low**: The lowest value recorded during the day.
   - **Close**: The closing value of the index at the end of the trading day.

2. **Data Import**:  
   I **imported the Excel sheet into Power BI**, which allowed me to leverage its advanced visualization capabilities to gain insights from the data.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   Using Power BI, I created various **visualization charts** to display trends and patterns in the NIFTY 50 index over the last decade. These visualizations highlight significant market movements, including:
   - Trends in opening and closing values.
   - Periods of high volatility (highs and lows).
   - Yearly and monthly performance patterns.

# Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of the NIFTY 50 index, helping to better understand its historical performance and fluctuations over time.
